# Non-Monadic Continuation Passing Style in Lean

For this project, I implemented a variety of continuation-passing-style
functions over common datatypes and proved their equivalence with non-CPS
analogues, with an eye toward detecting patterns in these proofs that might
enable their automation via metaprogramming. To this end, I placed considerable
value on minimality: I avoided using the simplifier or introducing any
additional axioms (especially classical ones) in my proofs (with one exception,
mentioned later), and I largely avoided using Lean's standard library (except
for in those cases in which I specifically wanted to examine the interaction
between user CPS code and standard-library built-ins). For this reason, I also
opted to consider CPS "purely," rather than in the context of Lean's system of
monads. To keep this project focused, and to work toward a thorough
understanding of the format of these proofs, I concentrated on specific
instances of CPS equivalences and observing the patterns therein, rather than
attempting to jump straight to metaprogramming.

Each section of my project is contained within a Lean file. Due to restrictions
on importable file names, the files are "lettered" rather than numbered (i.e.,
`A_lists.lean` corresponds to ยง1. Lists). Additionally, a summary of the data
structures and algorithms I considered, along with some highlights from each, is
provided below.
